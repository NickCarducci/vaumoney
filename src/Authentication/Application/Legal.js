                  “Once chosen, a malicious node could still try to inject
                  blocks of false transaction records into the blockchain.
                  Therefore, there is a follow-up implicit consensus step after
                  a peer node receives the block proposed by the official
                  validator. In this step, the peer nodes can verify the
                  transactions in the received new block, and if any anomaly is
                  detected in it (such as inconsistency of the linked hash
                  values, or mismatched transaction signature and identity),
                  they can keep the prior state of the blockchain without
                  accepting the new block. Otherwise if everything goes well,
                  the node confirms the new block and accepts the updated
                  blockchain. The likelihood of a block being rejected
                  diminishes exponentially with the number of acceptance
                  confirmations it receives from different nodes. After a
                  certain number (e.g., 6 in the case of Bitcoin) of
                  confirmations, the block is considered permanently committed
