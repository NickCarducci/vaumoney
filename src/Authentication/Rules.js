                Section 26.2642-1(c)(3) of the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Regulations
        provides generally that, for purposes of chapter 13, a transfer is a nontaxable gift to the
        extent the transfer is excluded from taxable gifts by reason of § 2503(b) (after
        application of § 2513) or § 2503(e). However, a transfer to a trust for the benefit of an
        individual is not a nontaxable gift for purposes of this section unless -- (i) trust principal
        or income may, during the individual’s lifetime, be distributed only to or for the benefit of
        the individual; and (ii) the assets of the trust will be includible in the gross estate of the
        individual if the individual dies before the trust terminates.

                    Thus the natural rate of interest is the rate at which
                    saving and the value of investment are exactly balanced, so
                    that the price level of output as a whole (II) exactly
                    corresponds to the money rate of the efficiency earnings of
                    the factors of production. Every departure of the market
                    rate from the natural rate tends, on the other hand, to set
                    up a disturbance of the price level by causing the second
                    term of the second fundamental equation to depart from zero.
