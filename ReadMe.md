The fact is that I’m not even given a chance to situate [truncated progressive fees](https://vau.money). _If you know any sponsor that would like to [try me](https://mailto:nick@vaults.biz), please I’m starving and am doing this as a potential competitor to Ticketmaster, I just haven’t implemented payments because I don’t want my income to be invested before I do it myself._ I am an injured bartender that pays taxes. I’ll probably make a brokerage after that given their cash accounts too _likely then also_ buy TIPS (and more), then I can take the most trusted tether claim.

Doesn’t ensuring price stability cause market exclusion?

I think I could operate the tightest bank to ever exist, but I'm not allowed to try without achieving Code of Federal Regulation Title 1 Chapter 1 Part 5 sponsorship. What gives? Are we bound to have our electronic funds invested for us before we consent to it forever? Is the problem rather that currency is actually NOT electronic, only its credit for cash vault debit? For readers, a reserve fiat is not the currency, that much I know for sure. I also know the omnibus bank OCC charter maintains its own account balance ledger, without a central master.

Why aren’t we allowed to decide when to invest ourselves with fee-based banks, phone number lookup, and background checks?

consensus open source?
